                <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p>Hello! I'm Vats Narsaria, a computer science student passionate about front-end development and
                    software engineering. I
                    enjoy building intuitive user interfaces and leveraging modern web technologies for seamless
                    experiences.</p>

                <p>I'm always looking to enhance my skills, collaborate on innovative projects, and deepen my
                    understanding of scalable
                    software solutions. Whether working with React or refining system design, I stay up-to-date with
                    emerging technologies.</p>

                <p>Currently, I'm seeking internships and projects where I can apply my expertise, learn from industry
                    professionals, and
                    contribute to impactful software solutions. Feel free to connect!</p>

            <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
            <p>Beyond coding, I have a passion for motorsports, aviation, and music. Here are some of my favorite
                things:</p>

            <h3>Motorsports and Cars</h3>

            <p>I like to watch Formula 1 and my favorite team is Ferrari. I also enjoy driving.</p>

            <h3>Aviation</h3>

            </video>
            <p>I am fascinated by airplanes, and it's my goal to get a flying license one day.</p>
            <p>Here's a video of my first <dfn>discovery flight</dfn>, which is a short introductory flight where a
                non-pilot can experience the basics of flying.</p>
            <p>My favorite aviation quote:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <em>“Learning to fly an airplane taught me a way of thinking, an approach to problem-solving that was
                    applicable and effective. Pilots are very methodical and meticulous, and artists tend not to
                    be.”</em>

                <cite>– Chris Carter</cite>
            </blockquote>

            <h3>Music</h3>

            <p>I love music and have a very diverse music taste. Here's a song that I'm vibing the most with currently:
